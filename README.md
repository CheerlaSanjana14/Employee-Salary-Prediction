# 🧠 Employee Salary Prediction System

This project predicts employee salaries based on years of experience using a simple neural network built with TensorFlow.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `salary.csv` – Dataset used for training and testing
- `employee_salary_prediction_notebook.ipynb` – Main notebook with code, training, and visualizations
- `README.md` – Project overview and usage info

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras  

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Loads and visualizes the dataset  
2. Preprocesses the data  
3. Splits into training and testing sets  
4. Builds a neural network model  
5. Trains the model and evaluates performance  
6. Predicts salary from input experience value

## 📊 Output

- Model predicts salary accurately based on years of experience  
- Visual graphs show correlation and training progress

## ✅ Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
